I"î<p>I wanted to provide some guidance on how to do forensics. I find the best way to learn is to have a scenario or task that youâ€™ve been assigned. Then go through the process of first planning and then executing to discover the artifacts that are needed.</p>

<p>For now I hope the content is helpful.</p>

<p>The blog posts in the category <em>Tasks</em> will have a rating in their tags which I think is reflective of how difficult it should be to complete. The following is a description of the ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Very Easy:</strong> The evidence you need is given. The task is well defined. The tools are beginner friendly.</p>
