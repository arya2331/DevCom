I"5	<p>I recently got asked by a colleague to help deliver an induction week brief. I received this brief when I first started and thought it was the best thing ever.</p>

<p>The purpose the brief to take an audience that may know nothing to knowing something about both IT and cyber security.</p>

<p>Normally at the end we would brief real world case studies but this year I wanted to give a live demo using msfvenom to create a reverse shell payload and see it work on a Windows 10 client. I’d follow that up by pulling and parsing the MFT to see that the file still existed in Windows and prove execution through a prefetch file.</p>

<p>I also wanted my work mates to go home and be able to replicate this so I created a playlist of videos showing you where to get the tools and VMs and how to install and use them.</p>

<p>Hope you find some use and as always if you have requests or questions send them through.</p>
